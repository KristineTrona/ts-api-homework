# Typescript-API homework

  This is a back-end only project that uses koa server together with typescript, type-orm and routing controllers 
to build a base for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. REST API endpoints are built for receiving a list of all games, starting 
a new game and for making updates to the game (such as making a move that alters the game board, where only one 
move at the time is allowed).
